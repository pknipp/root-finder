- decide what looks better in browser: single- or double quotes
- Import numpy, if that helps to polish properly
- Figure out how to have a favicon, presumably with an absolute path.
- Determine why my browser renders json differently, depending upon whether it's served by heroku or localhost.
- Present polynomial in both array- and string-form (but more pretty), regardless of how input (but do differently in json or html)
- Presentation of results:
    - combine CC pairs, using "+/-" sign
    - (completely) factored form, ie in terms of binomials, some of which may contain complex numbers
    - IF original polynomial had real coefficients and if there are some CC pairs, "maximally" factorize the polynomial, ie including some irreduciable quadratic factors.
